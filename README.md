# Minecraft 1.21 PaperMC Welcome Message Plugin

I made this plugin, for servers, that require special commands in every world like Overworld, etc.
You can modify, on the message whatever you want. 

It's very easy to use!!

I'm gonna focus on this project, and try to make it the most "user-friendly", for non programmers and youngsters.

# How to use?

First, you need to find, the *config.yml* file, and write the text, what you want to display on your own server.
There will be an extra option called: **broadcast-to-all**. If you want to publish the message to everyone, you should leave it on true, else change it to false.

After that, when you are ready with the message, and you saved it, you have to copy the following files to the following folder.


**First you have to download the zip file, then you have to search minecraft_motd_plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar**
*Open your server folder and search plugins folder.*
*Copy the **JAR** file to the plugins folder, then run your server.


**AND BASICALLY YOU ARE READY TO GO, ENJOY! :)**

# More from me:

**I'm planning to make a Maintenance plugin too, if I do some updates on my server, I can
easily set-up for the server status.**
**The other plugin is an efficiency plugin, that preloads and pregenerate the chunks, to
make the game run smooth.**
